Here is my game, Track This!

Originally planned to be a rhythm/space shooter hybrid, I instead focused more on a 3 level increasing complex pattern that progressively ramps up in speed per cycle of completion. You have 3 tracks to shift into place, and can only fire one bullet per track and until it disappears. The idea behind the game is that you are a space pilot trying to break the boundaries of speed and time in order to travel back in time, however, the Federation wants to stop you before you can reach the designated speed.

Interesting elements of gameplay include:
- 3 types of enemies: standard, speedy, and tank.
- Although Levels 1, 2, and 3 are the same, each cycle of completion of these levels will lead into the overall levels getting faster and faster.
- You regain a life per 20 points, and when you die, you warp back to the current level and cycle you died on.
